# nand2tetris

My solutions for the excellent [nand2tetris course](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), completed during the Spring 1 2023 batch at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

Most projects are in the course's dialect of hardware description language, while the [assembler](assembler), [vmtranslator](vmtranslator), and [compiler](compiler) are implemented in OCaml.
